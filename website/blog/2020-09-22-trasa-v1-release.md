We are excited to announce the general availability of Seknox TRASA 1.0. TRASA is a unified access control platform. We say it's a unified platform because it features

- two-factor authentication (like Duo Security, Gemalto SafeNet...),
- privilege access management (like CyberArk, Thycotic),
- zero trust access (like Google's beyondCorp) into a single platform.

<!--truncate-->

This release includes following features:

- **Native Two factor authentication: ** Protecting remote access to windows and Linux servers with two factor authentication.
- **Privilege Access Management: ** Monitoring and controlling regular and administrative user access.
