Some of the services assigned to you might need explicit request to Admin.  

If a service has a “Request Access” button instead of “Connect”, it needs an ad hoc request.
<img  alt="adhoc-service" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-service.png')} />

Click "Request Access" and choose an admin to request access.
<img  alt="adhoc-request" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-request.png')} />

You will get an email notification when the admin responds to your request.
