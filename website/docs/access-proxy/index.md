Access proxies are core server components in TRASA. Users typically access protected services via access proxies. Access proxies give us full visibility at the application layer (Layer 7 OSI) and allows to enforce more granular policies. 

Currently, TRASA supports four types of protocol.
1. HTTPs
2. SSH
3. RDP
4. Database (beta, Mysql only)
