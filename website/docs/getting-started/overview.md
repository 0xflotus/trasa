> This guide is for Administrators who wants to install and configure TRASA. If your security team has already deployed TRASA in your infrastructure and you are required to use TRASA for remote access, check out our [User Guides](https://www.trasa.io/docs/guides/getting-started "User Guides")

Welcome to TRASA docs. Before anything, let's answer your first question.

## What is TRASA?
TRASA is an open-source zero trust access control platform built by Seknox.

**What is zero trust?** It is probably your first question when you read above.

A **Zero Trust** is a security paradigm where access is granted based on  **_risks_** rather than just **_static policies_**

## How do you differentiate "risk" vs. "static policies"?
### Static policies
Control access based on the correctness of a combination of whitelisted IP source, time, and valid user credentials.

### Risk based policies
Control access by analyzing real-time contextual threats. E.g., verifying the reputation of IP source past 1 hour, analyze the cyber hygiene of devices used to access services, and in-session monitoring to identify malicious usage patterns.
