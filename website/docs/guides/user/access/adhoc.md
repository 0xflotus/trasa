Some of the services assigned to you might need explicit request to Admin.
Service might be configured as Adhoc, or you may not have permission to access the service.

If the services list on the TRASA dashboard has a “Request Access” button instead of “Connect”, it needs an ad hoc request.
<img  alt="adhoc-service" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-service.png')} />

Click "Request Access" and choose the admin to request access.
<img  alt="adhoc-request" src={('/img/docs/user-guides/access/adhoc-request.png')} />

You will get an email notification when admin responds to your request.
