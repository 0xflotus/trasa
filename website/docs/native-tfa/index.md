:::tip
This guide is about native two-factor authentication in Linux or Windows systems or via the TRASA Radius server. In most cases, we recommend using TRASA access proxy for two-factor authentication.

Though TRASA access proxies also support two-factor authentication without hassles of installing agents in servers, native two-factor authentication integrations are last-mile security protection.  


TRASA currently supports native two-factor authentication for:
1. **Windows systems -** using credential providers
2. **Linux and Unix systems -** using PAM modules
3. **Hardware devices -** using Radius server integration
