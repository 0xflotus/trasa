Policies are a core part of TRASA, without which TRASA is a mere directory of user and service profiles. Policies define how a user can access a service.

TRASA supports two types of policies:

1. **Basic Policy -** Supports time and location-based policy along with control over two-factor authentication, option for session recording, and permission for file transfers. 
   
2. **Device Hygiene -** Control access based on security hygiene of user devices
