TRASA securely controls user's access to protected services. In most cases, user's identities are managed by identity providers like active directory, LDAP servers, and service identities are managed in cloud service providers or data center virtualization platforms. TRASA integrates with these service platforms (providers) to seamlessly integrate with existing workflows.
