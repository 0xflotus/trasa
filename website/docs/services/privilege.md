Privileges are accounts with roles.
 
As an example, `root` is a privileged account usually found in Linux. `Administrator` is a privilege usually found in Windows systems.
 
In TRASA, when users access protected upstream service, they connect with the specific privilege. Users are assigned with privileges during a process called `access-mapping`.  
 
Privileged accounts are very security-sensitive by nature and should be used carefully. One core functionality of privilege access management is that privileged accounts are locked down as much as possible.
