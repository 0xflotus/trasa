This tutorial series only covers the basic scenario and shows one of many ways TRASA can protect internal access to your services.

But TRASA is a unified access control platform, meaning it offers many access control features to protect your teams and services. Below we list some other features which TRASA supports.

### SSH certificate auth

You can use TRASA to setup [SSH certificate authentication.](/docs/services/ssh/ssh-service)

### Secure credential storage, single sign on

You can use TRASA to store credentials in [credentials (password and keys) vault](/docs/providers/vault/tsxvault) so that you need not share a password with your teams or 3rd party support team.

### Radius authentication

Protect access to hardware devices (firewall, router, switch) with TRASA [radius server authentication](/docs/services/radius/radius-server)

### Native two factor authetnication

Native [two factor authentication](/docs/services/radius/radius-server) agent to protect windows and linux OS.

### Adhoc access policy

Implement maker checker type policy to make every access go through [mandatory access review.](/docs/policies/adhoc-policy)

### Integrations

Integrate with external [identity providers](/providers/providers) to import user's identity
